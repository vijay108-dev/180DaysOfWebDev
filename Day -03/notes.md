# HTML Notes – Anchor Tag and Image (Local Files)

---

## 1. How to Use Local Image or File in Anchor and Image Tag

- Local files can be used in anchor (`<a>`) and image (`<img>`) tags.
- Place the files (e.g., images, PDFs) in the **same folder** or **subfolder** as your HTML file.
- Use **relative paths** to reference those files in your HTML.

## 2. Absolute Path vs Relative Path

###  Absolute Path

- A path that starts from the **root directory** of the file system.
- It does **not depend** on where your HTML file is located.
- Works **only on your own system**, not after sharing or deployment.

### Relative Path

- A path defined **in relation to** the HTML file’s location.
- It is **portable**, works on **other systems** and after deployment.
- Preferred in **web development** for flexibility and compatibility.

## 3. Why We Do Not Use Absolute Path

- **Not Portable**: Works only on your system, fails on others.
- **Deployment Issues**: Absolute paths do not work on web servers.
- **Security Risk**: Reveals your personal folder structure.
